### BrowserClaw

**The browser for AI agents**

Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or any MCP client drives it using the accounts you're already signed into — while you watch live and replay every step.

**Two browsers, one codebase — we're building both.** Free and open source under AGPL-3.0, and everything runs on your machine.

## BrowserClaw

Your AI is smart, but it can't press the buttons. Ask it to book a flight, download an invoice, or reply to an email — it stops at the login screen. BrowserClaw fixes that: it's a real browser you install, sign into, and use like any other, and your AI drives it with the logins you already have — not a headless spec, not a cloud rental.

### Get started

1. **Install BrowserClaw and sign in** to the sites you use every day — it works like any browser, and every account you sign into becomes something your AI can use
2. **Connect your AI in one click** — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, VS Code, Zed, Antigravity; anything else that speaks MCP connects with a URL
3. **Give it a real task** — *"Book me the cheapest morning flight from SFO to NYC next Friday"* — then watch it live from your new tab and replay the whole run like a video

### Features

- **Your logins** — agents automate your real work using the sessions you already have, not a blank sandbox ([how it works](https://docs.browseros.com/browserclaw/how-it-works))
- **Isolated agent tabs** — every agent works in its own tabs and never touches yours; run several in parallel ([tabs & isolation](https://docs.browseros.com/browserclaw/tabs-and-isolation))
- **100% local** — sessions, screenshots, history, and settings never leave your machine ([privacy](https://docs.browseros.com/browserclaw/privacy))

## BrowserOS

An open-source Chromium fork that runs AI agents natively — the privacy-first alternative to ChatGPT Atlas, Perplexity Comet, and Dia. Use your own API keys or run local models with Ollama; your data never leaves your machine.

### Quick Start

1. **Download and install** BrowserOS — [macOS](https://files.browseros.com/download/BrowserOS.dmg) · [Windows](https://files.browseros.com/download/BrowserOS_installer.exe) · [Linux (AppImage)](https://files.browseros.com/download/BrowserOS.AppImage) · [Linux (Debian)](https://cdn.browseros.com/download/BrowserOS.deb)
2. **Import your Chrome data** (optional) — bookmarks, passwords, extensions all carry over
3. **Connect your AI provider** — Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, ChatGPT Pro via OAuth, or local models via Ollama/LM Studio

## FAQ

### What's the difference between BrowserClaw and BrowserOS?

BrowserClaw is a browser your AI drives; BrowserOS is a browser you drive, with an AI agent built in. They're standalone apps that live side by side — many people use BrowserOS as their daily browser and BrowserClaw as their agents' browser.

### Which AI tools work with BrowserClaw?

Any AI agent that supports MCP, which is essentially every serious AI coding tool today. Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, VS Code, Zed, and Antigravity connect with one click; anything else connects with a URL.

### Does my AI share my logins?

Yes — that's the point. Agents drive BrowserClaw using the sessions you already have, so they automate your real work instead of poking a blank sandbox. Per-agent profile isolation is on the roadmap if you want to keep them apart.

### Will my AI interrupt my browsing?

No. Every agent opens its own tabs to work in and never touches the ones you have open. It can't close the doc you're writing or steer the tab you're using — you keep working while it works.

### Can I run two AIs at the same time?

Yes. Every agent gets its own set of tabs, tracked separately. Codex and Claude Code can each work on their own tasks at the same time without stepping on each other.

### Can I replay what my AI did?

Yes. Every session is saved as a scrubbable video with a step-by-step action timeline. Rewind, spot the moment things went sideways, and give the agent a better instruction next time.

### Is my data safe? Does anything go to the cloud?

Everything runs on your machine. Session history, screenshots, replays, and settings are files on your disk, and your logins stay in your browser profile — same as any browser. There's no dashboard we own. Open source, top to bottom.

### What LLM providers does BrowserOS support?

11+ providers: Kimi, Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, ChatGPT Pro/Plus and GitHub Copilot via OAuth, OpenRouter, Azure, Bedrock — or fully local models through Ollama and LM Studio. Bring your own keys and switch anytime.

### Do my Chrome extensions and bookmarks work?

Yes. Both browsers are Chromium forks, so Chrome extensions work and your bookmarks, passwords, and settings import in one click.

### What platforms are supported?

BrowserClaw runs on macOS and Windows. BrowserOS runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux. System requirements match Google Chrome.

### Is it free?

Yes. Both products are free and open source under AGPL-3.0. You bring your own AI provider keys.

## Architecture

Both products ship from this monorepo, which has two main subsystems: the **browser** (Chromium fork) and the **agent platform** (TypeScript/Go).
